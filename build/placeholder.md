Check out this snippet of code: `function test() { return true; }`.

```
// Here's some multi-line JavaScript code:

const sampleFunction = (param1, param2) => {
  if (param1 === 'start' && param2 === 'end') {
    return 'Code Block';
  }
};
```

You can make text **bold** for emphasis, and _italic_ for style. Or combine them to create **_emphasized text_**! And if you need to show something as ~~strikethrough~~, you can do that too.

Need to include [web links](https://example.com) or even write a quote:

> "Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax."

And if tables are your thing, check this out:

| Header 1   | Header 2   | Header 3   |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Data Row 1 | Data Row 2 | Data Row 3 |
| More Data  | More Data  | More Data  |

    - You can use bullets.
        - And different levels of nesting.
            - Like this example.

1. Numbered lists are equally simple.
2. Use sequential numbers for ordering.
3. And remember to add some images:
